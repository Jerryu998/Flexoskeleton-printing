# Flexoskeleton printing
Here we provide details and resources for making 3D printed flexoskeleton structures. For more details please refer to our journal paper "XX" (link). Please cite XX for use. 

## Overview
3D printing soft and flexible components typically involves using soft fillaments. Here we demonstrate an alternate method of 3D printing soft and flexible robots which uses rigid filament but printed atop a flexible laminate. This method enables easy and rapid printing of flexible structures. The flexoskeleton printing process has the following advantages over typical multi-material printing:
1. Low-cost: this process can be performed on any fused-deoposition method 3D printer with a heated bed. We typically use the Prusa XX printers. 
2. Precision mechanical properties: Since the stiffness is controlled by layer thickness and geometry, flexure properties can be precisely controlled and gradients and heterogeneous stiffnesses embedded. 
3. Precision layout of joints/links in a robot: A flexoskeleton robot can be printed as a single monolithic entity. The printed material can define links and joints which produces functional, articulated components without any manual assembly.
